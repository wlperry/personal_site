# Welcome to my new webpage made in R. <img align="right" img src="images/perry.jpg" height="200px" width="200px" border="1" style="PADDING-TOP: 5px" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px"/>
     
## The work we do in the laboratory covers two broad areas of research

1. Bigeochemistry of streams and lakes    
    - Watershed management effects on stream water quality    
    - Nitrate removal of constructed wetlands        
    - Cover crop reduction of nitrate losses    
    - Monitoring water quality in streams entering two drinking water reservoirs    
      
2. Crayfish ecology and invasions    
    - Invasion dynamics in streams
    - Performance and behavior in flow
    - Morphological differences in response to flow
    
 
**Open graduate student positions:**
My laboratory is currently working predominately on three areas of research and we may have positions opening soon:    
<br>

1.  Effects of best management pratices and wetlands on agricultural tile drainage and streams.           
      - Help with ongoing data collection and analyses    
      - Develop their own project associated with ongoing projectes    
      
2.  Effectiveness of cover crops on water quality at the watershed scale. 
      - Help with ongoing data collection and analyses
      - Explore new aspects within the bounds of the project
      - Develop new R code to analyze the data
3.  Understanding sources, timing and fate of microplastics in streams and drinking water reservoirs
      - This project is currently not funded but undergraduates are welcome to explore projects in this area.
