#Welcome to my new webpage made in R. <img align="right" img src="images/perry.jpg" height="200px" width="200px" border="1" style="PADDING-TOP: 5px" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px"/>
     
##The work we do in the laboratory covers two broad areas of research

1. Bigeochemistry of streams and lakes    
    - Watershed management effects on stream water quality    
    - Nitrate removal of constructed wetlands        
    - Cover crop reduction of nitrate losses    
    - Monitoring water quality in streams entering two drinking water reservoirs    
      
2. Crayfish ecology and invasions    
    - Invasion dynamics in streams
    - Performance and behavior in flow
    - Morphological differences in response to flow
    
 
**Open graduate student positions:**
Our team has two graduate positions open in my laboratory for students interested in conservation of agricultural stream ecosystems. These are funded positions.    
<br>

1.  Effects of best management pratices and wetlands on agricultural streams          
      - The student will help with ongoing data collection and analyses    
      - The student can develop their own project or work on ongoing projectes    
      
2.  We are examining the effectiveness of cover crops on water quality at the watershed scale. 
      - The student will help with ongoing data collection and analyses
      - The student is welcome to explore new aspects within the bounds of the project of contribute to ongoing analyses
