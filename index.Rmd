## The work we do in the laboratory covers two broad areas of research

1. Bigeochemistry of streams, lakes, and tile-drained agricultural fields    
    - Watershed management effects on stream water quality    
    - Nitrate removal of constructed wetlands        
    - Cover crop reduction of nitrate losses    
    - Monitoring water quality in streams entering two drinking water reservoirs    
      
2. Crayfish ecology and invasions    
    - Invasion dynamics in streams
    - Performance and behavior in flow
    - Morphological differences in response to flow
    
 
**Open graduate student positions:**
My laboratory is currently working on one primary project:    
<br>

1.  Role of cover crops in reducing nutrient loss from a new experimental plot system using a new cash cover crop.The aspects of this project we will be working on are:             
      - Soil quality and nutrient content     
      - porewater nitrogen concentrations with and without cover crops     
      - weed diversity and biomass associated with cover crops compared to reference
      - honeybee use of the cover crop
      - nutrient loss from tile water
